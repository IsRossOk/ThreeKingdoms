                <h2>The Yellow Turban Rebellion</h2>
                <p>The first great spark came in 184 AD, when Zhang Jiao’s Taoist-inspired “Yellow Turban” movement ignited across northern China. Promising a new era of peace and equality, the rebels rose against the Han state. Though eventually crushed, their uprising fatally weakened imperial control and elevated many warlords who would later dominate the political landscape.</p>

                <h2>The Fall of Luoyang</h2>
                <p>As the Han dynasty weakened, the imperial capital at Luoyang became a symbol of both power and chaos. When the warlord Dong Zhuo seized control of the city in 189 AD, he forced the young Emperor Xian to serve as a puppet ruler. To secure his position, Dong Zhuo infamously ordered Luoyang to be burned and relocated the court west to Chang’an (now Xi'an). The once-great capital was left in ruins, marking the symbolic end of Han imperial stability and the beginning of the age of warlords.</p>

                <p>
                Sun Jian’s campaigns in central China brought him into conflict with regional powers such as Liu Biao. Situated on the Han river, the city of Xiangyang in modern-day Hubei province, with its formidable walls and gates, became a critical strategic point and was alternately held by Wu, Shu, and Wei. Fancheng across the river was the scene of Guan Yu's defeat at the hands of Lü Meng.</p>

                <h2>Writings and Legacy</h2>
                <p>The writings attributed to Zhuge Liang and other leaders of the period provide insight into military strategy, governance, and philosophy. He was known for his extraordinary intellect and foresight, penned an influential essay detailing the political and military challenges facing Liu Bei. So impressed was Liu Bei that he famously visited Zhuge Liang three times to secure his assistance, a story immortalised in historical texts and folklore. This counsel laid the foundation for the later consolidation of Shu Han and numerous strategic campaigns against rival warlords. Manuscripts, letters, and chronicles help reconstruct the events of the era.</p>
